In the web world there's really two different components that exist we have the client and we have the 
server so anytime that you go on a website you go on a specific url what ends up happening is the client
is going to make a request to the server to get some data the server is then going to process that request and 
then return the data to the client. 
once that's done the client is going to render that data and there you go you can see all of your data.
